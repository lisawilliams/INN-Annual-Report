    ,"text": "Denise Malan started in June as the INN/IRE director of data services, who helps INN members collaborate on data projects and better utilize the resources at IRE and NICAR. She is currently leading three collaborative projects and has helped other members with obtaining NICAR data.</p></p><em>Editorial collaborations:</em> </p><p> <ul><li><strong>FDA import refusals:</strong> Three INN members (InvestigateMidwest, FairWarning and the Food and Environment Reporting Network) are working on stories from the FDA import refusal and OASIS import databases. The stories show which foreign products are most likely to be rejected, such as spices and seafood. This collaboration has taken longer than expected while waiting for data from the FDA, dealing with the government shutdown and trying to get more information out of an uncooperative federal agency. Once the data was received, Denise analyzed it and found unique angles for each of the three members. Publication is expected in the first quarter of 2014. </li><li><strong>Schools and traffic pollution:</strong> More than a dozen INN members worked on local stories looking for schools that are dangerously close to heavily trafficked roads, putting children at risk of asthma and absenteeism. <aside><h4>Participating newsrooms in \"Schools & Pollution\" collaborative investigation:<br>InvestigateWest <br>Eye on Ohio <br>Voice of San Diego</h4></aside> This project uses methodology developed by InvestigateWest and datasets from each state. While we did have great interest in the project initially, not all members were able to produce stories. Some areas did not have enough traffic to generate pollution worries, and other areas did not have any schools located close enough to busy highways. Three members have published stories so far, with three to four more expected in the first month of 2014. The three members that have published stories all reported that they had a great response from their readers. The project also has made a real impact on children in those areas. In Seattle, the public schools have started issuing air pollution alerts so schools know when to keep children inside. In San Diego, the school district has promised not to continue using a loophole in state law that allowed them to put schools near busy roadways, and in Ohio the state is considering adding traffic recommendations in their state school siting standards. <li><strong>Hazardous materials incidents:</strong> This collaboration uses a national dataset from the NICAR library. Data library director Liz Lucas and NICAR staff updated the database for INN’s use, so it included data from 1970 through September 2013. Denise took state slices of the data for each member that was interested and put together a project guide, including information about the database, potential story ideas and local sources to interview. In all, 21 members have expressed interest in the project, which kicked off in early December. By the end of the year, one member had published a story, with the rest expected in January or February 2014. MinnPost took a unique approach to the project, making a graphic story rather than a narrative. <aside><h4>Want to see MinnPost's innovative approach? <a href =\"http://www.minnpost.com/data/2014/01/visualizing-hazmat-incidents-minnesota\">Click here</a>.</h4></aside> MinnPost also made its code available on GitHub, which can be a resource for other members working on the project. MinnPost</p></li></ul><p><em>Other highlights</em><br><br> <ul><li>Started an INN data collaboration team with about a dozen members who meet monthly to discuss ongoing data collaborations, training and new project ideas. The group has been very successful with members sharing their stories that could be scaled out to other INN members. <li>Helped INN members access the NICAR database library, including the National Bridge Inventory for the I-News Network in Colorado during the September floods there.</li> <li>Entered a proposal in the Knight News Challenge for an air sensor project that would start with 10 INN members and include development of inexpensive, easily replicated sensors and an open-source software platform to analyze and display the results. Though the proposal did not get funded through the challenge, INN continues to seek funding through other partners. <li>Organized a training webinar led by Sunlight Foundation about campaign finance data. The goal is for this to become a monthly member-to-member training webinar. Organized a training webinar with new company SwayWhat, a social data-sharing platform. Eight members attended the training. <li>Taught Excel and SQL at IRE computer-assisted reporting boot camps and conferences, as well as help with training as needed. <li>Helped INN members access IRE resources such as free subscriptions to CometDocs and TableauPublic, which can help them convert data from pdfs to Excel and visualize data on the web. <li> Wrote proposal for INN members-only boot camp at Investigative Reporters and Editors in the first half of 2014. The proposal is pending. <li> Wrote proposal for the BBC Real America project looking at guns in America. Though the proposal wasn’t chosen for this grant project, the BBC expressed interest in working with INN on a collaboration in the future. <li> Along with Lisa Williams, INN director of digital engagement, started a new weekly newsletter to keep members informed about collaborations, training, datasets available for localization and stories available for republication. Though the newsletter is only a few weeks old, we have seen a great response from members.</p>"

    ,"text": "<p>One of INN’s mandates is to help our members with revenue generation, so in 2013 we began developing Impaq.me, a new social engagement product which will give nonprofit organizations an innovative “click and share” method of raising funds while partnering with philanthropists…individuals, corporations and foundations. The program works much like a digital advertising campaign, in that it uses web-based social engagement tools such as Facebook, Twitter and email to share stories or projects which then generate charitable donations on a matching basis with a donor. When a reader shares a story using Impaq.me, that reader has the opportunity to donate a dollar which will be matched by the funder on a one-to-one basis. The more readers clicking and sharing the story will generate more dollar-for-dollar matches up to the limit of the campaign. </p><P>Thanks to the Ethics and Excellence in Journalism Foundation providing seed money, we developed a prototype and are (as of this writing) in the second of three test phases. In the first test, eight INN member organizations initiated a campaign with $2,500 each. The results were surprising. Only 10% of overall donations were at the $1.00 level, while contributions between $11-25 came in at 33%.  </p><p>Additional observations on this test:<ul><li>* Our members are on the serious side of the news spectrum.  But what users are choosing to share is the most serious, long-form journalism that our members create.  Impaq.me is showing us that users are motivated to share serious, long-form journalism.  <li>* We track the number of clicks each shared item gets.  What we found out?  Users are choosing to click on what we call \"affiliation opportunities\" -- announcements of Kickstarter campaigns, fundraising events, and year-end appeals.  Out of the top 10 most-clicked items, three were for affiliation opportunities.  We have relatively few opportunities to gain insight into the moment when readers cross the barrier from being mere consumers to being supporters.  While we didn't expect Impaq.me to deliver this kind of insight, this has given us solid information on what works when it comes to recruiting reader support for investigative and community journalism. <li>* Participants in the Impaq.me trial saw gains in the effectiveness of their social media sharing -- the number of times a shared item was clicked went up during the campaign.  Everyone has been looking for technologies that increase the effectiveness for social sharing -- if we have discovered that the thing that increases social sharing is altruism and opportunities to affiliate with institutions readers believe in, that's news. </ul><p>When testing is complete (by the second quarter of 2014), INN will then use the empirical data to create a campaign to support the total cost of build-out, staffing and marketing. Early results are demonstrating that Impaq.me will work for all types of nonprofits, not just journalism. </p>"
